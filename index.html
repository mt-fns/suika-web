                Coding truly is my *passion* (I picked this major because I like money).
                I started programming in the womb to maximize my chances of getting a 200k+ position
                at Google.
            </p>
            <p>
                After going through first year in uni, I realized that I wanted to build
                apps instead of doing C and assembly (L ðŸ’€). Even after doing my own projects,
                I still felt empty and I realized that real computer science was the friends we made along the way.
