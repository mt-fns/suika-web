         <h3 class="card-title">The *CompSci* Experience</h3>
         <p>
             Coding truly is my *passion* (I picked this major because I like money).
             I started programming in the womb to maximize my chances of getting a 200k+ offer
             from Google. After going through first year in uni, I realized that I wanted to build
             stuff instead of inverting a binary tree in O(1) time. Even after doing my own projects
             I still felt empty and I realized that real computer science was the friends we made along the way.
